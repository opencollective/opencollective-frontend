// The below helpers use a try-catch to gracefully fallback in these scenarios:
// - SSR (server-side rendering), where the emulated context might not have localStorage.
// - Some robots and crawlers (like Google), although these usually either don't execute JS,
//   or do so in a modern engine with supported (but ignored) localStorage.
// - Private browsing mode. Here, localStorage methods may throw exceptions.
// - Regular browsing mode, if the user configured the browser to require permission before
//   storing data. If the current site isn't yet whitelisted and JS attempts to access
//   window.localStorage, an exception is thrown. Even `if (window.localStorage)` crashes.
// - Regular browsing mode, where localStorage is full. In those cases, localStorage.setItem()
//   will throw an exception.
