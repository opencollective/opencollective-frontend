# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: November 13th 2025**

These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") apply to your access to and use of the **Open Collective Platform**, accessible through **opencollective.com** and related domains, as well as other websites, applications, and online services (collectively, "**the Platform**" or "**the Services**"). The Platform is provided and operated by **OFi Technologies LLC** ("**OFiTech**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**"), a company 100% owned and controlled by **Open Finance Consortium Inc.**, a Delaware **501(c)(6)** nonprofit corporation ("**OFi Consortium**" or "**OFiCo**"). **By creating an account or otherwise accessing the Platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 18 that applies to residents of the United States, do not access or use our Platform.**

If you have any questions about these Terms, you may contact us at [support@opencollective.com](mailto:support@opencollective.com). Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://opencollective.com/privacypolicy) for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.

## 1. Overview of Our Platform

(a) Our Platform provides a system that may be used by individuals ("Individuals"), by legal entities ("Organizations" or "Independent Collectives"), and by groups with a shared purpose ("Collectives") to create accounts and collaborate around shared financial activity.

Individuals, and Organizations (and Independent Collectives) can participate directly on the Platform, for example by contributing funds to Collectives or by submitting and receiving payment for expenses. Collectives use a Host to collect and disburse funds that support their activities.

The goal of the Platform is to promote transparency and make it easier to track incoming and outgoing funds for the benefit of Individuals, Collectives, and Organizations (and Independent Collectives).

Below is a list of the main roles that may be associated with each Collective, Organization (and Independent Collective):

- **"Host"** - an Organization that receives and holds funds contributed by Financial Contributors via the Platform on behalf of one or more Collectives. Hosts may also be referred to as "Fiscal Hosts". Additional terms for Hosts are included in Section 7 below.

- **"Contributor"** - a Contributor is an individual or entity that participates in the Collective in some way, such as by acting as a Collective Admin, Financial Contributor, or Expense Submitter, or by participating in any other way.

- **"Admin"** - an Admin is a Contributor that has administrator responsibilities for a Collective or an Organization (or an Independent Collective), including editing its content and the ability to approve expense payments associated with the Collective or Organization (or Independent Collective). Additional terms for Collective Admins are included in Section 5 below.

- **"Financial Contributor"** - a Financial Contributor is a Contributor that uses the Platform to contribute funds to a Host that are intended to support a particular Collective. Additional terms for Financial Contributors are included in Section 4 below.

- **"Expense Submitter"** - an Expense Submitter is a Contributor that submits a payment request in connection with an expense incurred by that user in support of a Collective. Additional terms for Expense Submitters are included in Section 8 below.

(b) For clarity, the Platform does not at any time receive, hold, or control funds on behalf of users.
All funds are collected and disbursed by Hosts through integrated third-party services such as Stripe, PayPal, or Wise ("Payment Processors"), or through other manual payment methods.
Payment Processors handle contributions from Financial Contributors and disburse approved expense payments on behalf of Hosts.
They may charge their own fees ("Payment Processor Fees") as described in Section 9(c).
Payment Processors are independent third parties, and OFiTech is not responsible for their actions, omissions, or system errors, including any delays, fees, or losses they may cause.

(c) You acknowledge and agree that: (i) OFiTech is not a party to and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes, or any relationships whatsoever between users; (ii) OFiTech does not have any responsibility to investigate or verify the reputation, conduct, morality or criminal background of any user; and (iii) OFiTech has no responsibility with respect to determining or paying applicable taxes with respect to the Collective or any users.

## 2. Eligibility

(a) You must be at least 18 years of age to access or use our Platform. If you are accessing or using our Platform on behalf of another person or entity, (i) you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be bound by these Terms and to be responsible to us if you violate these Terms, and (ii) references to "you" will mean you and that person or entity, collectively. To use the Platform you represent that you have never committed, participated in, or been prosecuted for fraud.

(b) You may not access or use our Platform if you are located in a jurisdiction where the provision of our Platform is prohibited by law (a "**Prohibited Jurisdiction**"), and you may not provide access to our Platform to any entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction. You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not named on any U.S. government list of persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports, or transacting with any U.S. person; and (ii) you are not a national of, or a company registered in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction.

## 3. User Accounts and Account Security

You may need to register for an account to access some or all of the Platform. If you register for an account, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security of your account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. You are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.

## 4. Terms for Financial Contributors

This Section applies to you if you use the Platform as a Financial Contributor.

(a) **Responsibility.** Before committing to make any contribution via the Platform, each Financial Contributor must (i) read the full description of the Collective and its mission, and (ii) review the criteria and process requirements specified by the Collective and its Host (if any) for receiving expense payments. By contributing to the Host for designation to a Collective, you agree to look solely to the applicable Contributors or Host of the applicable Collective to resolve any questions or disputes regarding contributions or expected payments.

(b) **Contributions.** Each contribution you make is paid directly to an Organization (or Independent Collective) that receives and holds funds. When a contribution is intended for a Collective, it is received and held by the Organization acting as its Host and must be used (less any applicable fees) in support of the designated Collective. When a contribution is intended for an Organization (or Independent Collective), it is held and used in accordance with that Organization’s stated purpose and terms.

When making a contribution, you may be offered the option to include a voluntary Platform Tip to support the operation of the Platform, as described in Section 9(a).

Our Platform allows you to use and store a payment method via the Platform that is acceptable to us ("**Payment Method**") to pay for any contributions or to receive any expense payments. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the Payment Method. You authorize our designated third-party Payment Processor to charge the amount specified to your Payment Method for any contribution you authorize via the Platform. If the Payment Method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your contribution may be suspended or cancelled automatically. Some Payment Methods may be offered as separately branded Payment Processor services (such as PayPal), and you agree to comply with the terms of those services.

(c) **Recurring Payments.** You may authorize a recurring contribution to a Host for designation to a Collective by indicating as much through the Platform ("**Recurring Contribution**").
For a Recurring Contribution, you are authorizing our designated Payment Processor to charge the amount specified to your Payment Method on the day that the initial contribution is made and to charge the same amount every calendar month thereafter (or every year if the renewal period is annual).
If the initial contribution was made with a Platform Tip, the Platform Tip will be included on each recurring payment.
**When you initiate a recurring contribution to a Host for designation to a Collective, you expressly agree that our Payment Processor is authorized to charge you on a monthly basis (or on an annual basis, if specified via the platform) for the same payment amount until you cancel it or we suspend or stop providing you access to the platform in accordance with these Terms.**

(d) **Cancellations.** Financial Contributors can cancel or change the amount of a Recurring Contribution via [opencollective.com/dashboard/outgoing-contributions](https://opencollective.com/dashboard/outgoing-contributions).

(e) **Refunds.** Except as provided in these Terms, **all contributions are final, and there are no refunds**. You agree (i) to look solely to the Contributors or Host of an applicable Collective to resolve any disputes regarding contributions that you make via the Platform, and (ii) that the Collective Admin or Host are solely responsible for providing any refunds. Any refunds initiated by Contributors or Hosts via the Platform may be credited to the Payment Method maintained in your account.

(f) **Recognition.** Financial Contributors may receive certain advertising, marketing, or other recognition ("**Recognition**") in exchange for their contributions. Subject to these terms, all Financial Contributors will receive the following Recognition: logo placement on the Collective page together with a link to the Financial Contributor’s profile page ("**Baseline Recognition**"). Financial Contributors may receive additional Recognition if specified by an Collective Admin within the applicable Collective page. Each Financial Contributor acknowledges and agrees that any Recognition beyond the Baseline Recognition is provided solely by the Collective Admin and the Host of the applicable Collective, and that OFiTech is not responsible for fulfilling any, and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to, such supplemental Recognition offered by the Collective. Financial Contributors agree to look solely to the applicable Host or Collective Admin regarding receipt of any supplemental Recognition.

(g) **Intellectual Property Rights.** To receive Baseline Recognition, Financial Contributors must provide a logo or similar branding material via the Platform. To the extent a Financial Contributor provides any trademarks, trade names, logos or other branding materials to OFiTech ("**Financial Contributor Marks**"), the Financial Contributor hereby grants (i) to OFiTech a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to use and display the Financial Contributor Marks via the Platform for purposes of fulfilling the Baseline Recognition and any supplemental Recognition offered by the applicable Collective, and (ii) to the Collective Admin, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and display the Financial Contributor Marks as mutually agreed upon by the Financial Contributor and the Collective Admin in connection with any supplemental Recognition.

## 5. Terms for Collective Admins

This Section applies to you if you use the Platform as a Collective Admin.

(a) Each Collective Admin must (i) ensure that the mission and purpose of the Collective are accurately and clearly disclosed via the Platform at all times; (ii) ensure that a Host has been designated for the Collective that is acceptable to OFiTech; (iii) set the parameters (including amounts to be contributed) for participation in the Collective by Financial Contributors, including the recognition or other items provided to Financial Contributors in connection with a contribution; (iv) ensure that the Collective page provides clear and accurate descriptions regarding the criteria and process for approving Expense Submitter payments; (v) verify the accuracy of any request for payment by an Expense Submitter before approving the payment via the Platform; (vi) only approve payment requests for legitimate activities of Expense Submitters made in support of the Collective and its mission; and (vii) fulfill any Recognition (described in Section 6 below) offered to Financial Contributors by the Collective in connection with their contributions.

(b) Each Collective Admin further will (i) comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Collective’s activities; (ii) ensure that all payment transactions associated with a Collective are disclosed via the Platform, including contributions and expense payments; (iii) maintain up-to-date contact information on the Collective’s page, so that the Collective’s Host and Financial Contributors can contact the Collective Admin; and (iv) promptly respond to inquiries from a Collective’s Financial Contributors and Host regarding the Collective’s activities.

## 7. Terms for Hosts

This Section applies to you if you use the Platform as a Host.

(a) **Set-Up.** Any person or entity seeking to serve as Host for a Collective must be approved via the Platform. Hosts must remit any Platform Tips collected through the Platform to OFiTech as described in Section 9(a). Hosts are also subject to the plan terms and usage allowances described in Section 9(e).

(b) **Contributions.** You agree to accept contributions of funds from Financial Contributors for designation to a specific Collective ("**Collective Funds**"). You must take accounting measures to segregate Collective Funds from your other funds, and maintain and use the Collective Funds solely for the benefit of the designated Collective and in accordance with these Terms. The Platform is designed to assist you in satisfying these responsibilities, by enabling you to export the global ledger and helping you to track the budget of each Collective to determine whether the Collective is operating as intended.

(c) **Expense Payments.** You may receive requests for payment of Collective Funds in the form of Expenses (**Expenses**) from Collective Admins in connection with expense payment requests submitted by Expense Submitters. Expenses must be approved by a Collective Admin through the Platform before they are eligible for payment. You are responsible for reviewing Expenses to confirm that they meet the Collective’s applicable criteria and process requirements for payment, and only authorizing disbursements if the Expense meets such requirements and is permitted under applicable law. If the Expense meets such requirements, you will authorize disbursement of the applicable amount of Collective Funds via the Platform.

(d) **Host Fees**. You may charge a reasonable fee to the Collective in exchange for providing host services. You must disclose this fee clearly and conspicuously in advance of accepting any Collective Admin’s request that you serve as a Host for a Collective. Host Fees are distinct from and in addition to any Platform Tips or Platform Fees described in Section 9(a).

(e) **Tax Deduction.** You are responsible for providing any tax receipts, if applicable, to Financial Contributors who make contributions. Our Platform helps facilitate your compliance responsibilities by issuing receipts to Financial Contributors. However, you are responsible for providing all the details that will appear on those receipts to make sure that they can be tax deductible receipts (if applicable).

(f) **Compliance.** You must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your Host activities, including money transmission, record keeping, accounting, tax, and other compliance requirements. You represent and warrant that (i) you have full power and authority to perform the obligations to the Collective; (ii) your use of the Platform, and performance under these Terms, will not violate any contractual or other restrictions applicable to you or any applicable law, rule or regulation.

(g) If a Collective is terminated with an outstanding balance of Collective Funds, you will use or disburse the remaining funds in accordance with applicable law and your bylaws (if applicable).

## 8. Expense Submitter Terms

Expense Submitters must only submit requests for payment via the Platform for expenses they actually incurred in support of a Collective. Any payment request made through the Platform must include a valid invoice or receipt indicating the expenses actually incurred by the Expense Submitter, and any other information required by the Host or Contributors of that Collective. Expense Submitters are solely responsible for submitting accurate information via the Platform for their designated payment account. At a minimum, such expense or invoice should include the date, the full legal name and address of the provider of the good or service and the final amount paid, including tax if applicable. This information is not automatically published by us via our Platform, and we require Hosts and Contributors via these Terms not to disclose the information to third parties.

## 9. Fees

(a) **Platform Tips.** The Platform, operated by OFiTech, relies primarily on voluntary Platform Tips to sustain its operation, development, and maintenance.

Platform Tips are included in the total amount collected by the Host when a Contributor makes a payment. They are accounted for separately from Collective Funds and do not reduce the amount contributed to the Collective. For recurring contributions, Platform Tips are included on each recurring payment.

The Host is responsible for remitting Platform Tips to OFiTech (or its affiliates). Remittance may occur:
a. automatically through the payment processor’s integrated "application fee" mechanism (for example, Stripe); or
b. periodically through invoicing or reconciliation when automatic transfer is not available.

In cases where Platform Tips where not enabled or available for a Contribution, OFiTech may apply a Platform Fee charged to the Host (as defined in Section 9(e)).

(c) **Payment Processor Fees**. If you use a Payment Processor (as defined in Section 1(b)) to collect contributions or disburse expense payments, that third-party service may charge additional fees ("Payment Processor Fees"). These fees are charged directly by the Payment Processor, and OFiTech is not responsible for them or for any actions, omissions, or errors by the Payment Processor.

(d) **Taxes.** It is the Host’s responsibility to determine what, if any taxes apply to collection of contributions and disbursement of expense payments, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes. It is also the Host’s responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. OFiTech is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or similar tax arising from any transaction completed via the Platform.

(e) **Platform Fees.** For Contribution not subject to Platform Tips, the Platform applies a 15% "Platform Share (or "Host Fee Share"). If your Host Fee is 10% and your Collectives bring in $1,000, the Host gets $100 and $15 (15%) is the "Platform Share".

## 10. User Content

(a) Our Platform may allow you and other users to create, post, store and share content, including messages, text, photos, videos, software and other materials (collectively, "**User Content**"). Except for the license you grant below, you retain all rights in and to your User Content, as between you and OFiTech.

When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Platform, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your username or profile photo) will be visible to the public.

## 17. Disclaimers

(b) Your use of our **Platform** is at your sole risk. Our **Platform** is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, OFiTech does not represent or warrant that our **Platform** is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.

(b) The total liability of OFiTech and the other OFiTech Parties, for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Platform, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to access or use our Platform during the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to your claim.

## 20. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration for U.S. Residents

**If you are a resident of the U.S. this Section 20 applies. Please read the following section carefully because it requires residents of the United States to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with OFiTech and limits the manner in which they can seek relief from us.**

(a) Except for small claims disputes in which you or OFiTech seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or OFiTech seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and OFiTech waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Platform resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Platform will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in San Francisco, California in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("**Rules**") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("**JAMS**"), which are available on the [JAMS website](http://www.jamsadr.com/) and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(b) **You and OFiTech agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Platform is personal to you and OFiTech and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.**

(c) You and OFiTech agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 18 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and Company agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Company, Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and OFiTech agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

(d) **Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Platform must be filed within one year after the claim arises; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and OFiTech will not have the right to assert it.**

(e) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 18 by contacting us at [support@opencollective.com](mailto:support@opencollective.com). In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 19.

## 21. Governing Law and Venue

These Terms and your access to and use of our Platform will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to Section 20 or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California.

## 22. Changes to these Terms

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Platform and update the "Last Updated" date above. We may also attempt to notify you by sending an email notification to the address associated with your account or providing notice through our Platform. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately and your continued access to and use of our Platform after we provide notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. In any case, changes to these Terms will not be retroactive. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Platform.

## 23. Termination or Suspension

We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your account or your right to access or use our Platform. A Collective can also be suspended or discontinued at any time by us, the Host or the Collective Admin. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Platform. You may stop using the Platform at any time. If we terminate or suspend your access to your account or our Platform, any licenses or rights we grant under these Terms will be immediately revoked.

## 24. Severability

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## 25. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and OFiTech relating to your access to and use of our Platform. The failure of OFiTech to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
