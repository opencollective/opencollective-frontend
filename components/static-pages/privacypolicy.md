**Last Updated: 2025-02-26**

<p class="lead">This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by OFi Technologies LLC ("OFi Technologies", "we", "us", or "our"), a company 100% owned and controlled by Open Finance Consortium, a C3 non-profit. The opencollective.com website is operated by OFi Technologies LLC. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites and online services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

## Data Controller

OFi Technologies LLC is the data controller of your personal information. We are responsible for, and determine how your personal data is processed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at info@opencollective.com.

## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, make a payment, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, payment method information and any other information you choose to provide.

### Information We Collect Automatically

When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

- **Log Information:** We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
- **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, local storage and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. Local Storage similarly enables our Services to store data (like login tokens) securely in your browser and unlike cookies, it's not sent to the server on every request. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.</li>

### Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may also obtain information from other sources. For example, if you connect your account with an account you have with a third-party service (such as GitHub), we will have access to certain information from that service, such as your profile information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. Additionally, we may collect information about you from third-party sources that help us to learn more about you, like for example your profile picture or social media handles.

- **Performance of Contract**: Processing your information is necessary to provide the Services to you, such as creating an account, processing contributions, or handling expense reimbursements.

- With hosts and organizers of a collective, if you are a contributor, or request reimbursement for expenses made in support, of that collective. The collective may use your information for the same purposes and under the same conditions as those outlined in this document. However, it remains solely and exclusively responsible for complying with its legal and declarative obligations in processing your personal data that it carries out by itself, with its own means, and for its own needs.

## Third-Party Service Providers

We work with third-party service providers to perform various operations related to our Services. These providers may have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Our main third-party service providers include:

- **Stripe, PayPal, Wise**: Payment processors that handle financial transactions. When you make a payment through our platform, your payment information is collected and processed directly by these providers according to their privacy policies.

Each of these providers maintains their own privacy policies that govern how they use, store, and process the data they receive. We encourage you to review these policies for more information about their practices.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Specifically:

- Account information is retained for as long as your account remains active, plus a retention period after account closure for legal and accounting purposes
- Financial transaction data is kept for at least 7 years to comply with tax and accounting requirements
- Communication records may be retained for 2 years after your last interaction with us

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

These companies may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Open Collective and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand how our services are being used.
