This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Open Collective, Inc. ("Open Collective" or “we”).

We collect information you provide directly to us.  For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form,  make a payment, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.

<li><b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</b>  We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, local storage and web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits.

<h4>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h4>
We may also obtain information from other sources.  For example, if you connect your account with an account you have with a third-party service (such as GitHub), we will have access to certain information from that service, such as your profile information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service.  Additionally, we may collect information about you from third-party sources that help us to learn more about you, like for example your profile picture or social media handles. </div>

    <div style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2.2rem;">GDPR</div>
    <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;"><h4>Compliance</h4>
Open Collective is GDPR compliant. We are not in the business of selling data to any 3rd party. Our business model is to take a commission on the money raised by Collectives (like most other crowdfunding platforms). Companies that sponsors Collectives don't get access to private information. Only the admins of the Collective (core contributors) and of the organization that is legally hosting the Collectives (fiscal sponsor) get access to your email address. We don't store credit card information on our servers (we only store a token if you have decided to save it to your profile). We don’t store any passwords. Since our entire code base is open source, anyone can easily audit it.
