# About

Open Collective was founded by idealists to make online communities more sustainable. What began as a tool for open source and grassroots groups has grown into a global infrastructure for transparency, collaboration, and shared financial stewardship.

### Our beginnings

The foundations of Open Collective were laid in 2015, when our founders realized that community groups were held back by the need for legal status to receive and manage money.

Their solution was a new kind of financial infrastructure: one that gives groups access to fiscal sponsorship, enabling them to raise and spend funds under the umbrella of a trusted legal entity while staying focused on their mission.

For many, this was transformative. Collectives could finally operate openly, with transparent budgets and clear public ledgers, reassuring contributors and partners alike. From the start, transparency was at the heart of our model, not just in how money moves but in how decisions are made.

### Growing the movement

In the years that followed, the platform became home to thousands of communities across the world, from open source projects and climate initiatives to local mutual aid networks.

To better serve this global community, we helped launch a family of nonprofit fiscal hosts such as **Open Source Collective** and **Open Collective Europe**. Each has extended the reach of our mission and adapted the model to local needs.

When global crises emerged, these hosts enabled thousands of collectives to mobilize resources quickly and act where they were most needed. From digital infrastructure to solidarity projects, the Open Collective Platform became a trusted backbone for collaboration.

### Transitioning to community ownership

In 2022, Open Collective Inc. announced its commitment to an "exit to community," a pledge to evolve from a traditional startup into a community-owned platform.

That vision became reality in 2024, when stewardship of the platform transitioned to a new nonprofit: the **Open Finance Consortium Inc. (OFiCo)**, a U.S. 501(c)(6) association created by and for the fiscal hosts and communities who rely on it.

OFiCo now governs the platform collectively, while its subsidiary **OFi Technologies (OFiTech)** operates the platform. Together, they continue the original Open Collective mission: enabling transparent, collaborative finance for communities everywhere.

### Our future

Today, the Open Collective Platform, operated by OFiTech under OFiCo's stewardship, powers thousands of collectives and organizations managing millions in contributions across currencies, countries, and causes.

Our work continues to evolve, but the core principle remains unchanged: **money should move in the open, in service of communities**.

As we enter this new chapter, our mission is to strengthen and expand this infrastructure for the long term, ensuring that the tools of open finance remain open, sustainable, and collectively governed for the years ahead.
