# Open Collective Widgets

## For collectives

### Donate button

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:collectiveSlug/:verb/button.js" color="[white|blue]"></script>

Just replace `:collectiveSlug` with the slug of your collective (e.g., webpack for https://opencollective.com/webpack).
The verb can either be "donate" or "contribute".
Example:

<center><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button.js"></script><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button.js" color="blue"></script><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/contribute/button.js" color="blue"></script><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/contribute/button.js"></script></center>

If you want to add a donate button to a blog post, you can load an image version of the logo and then link to the donate page of your collective.

    <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button@2x.png?color=blue" width=300 />
    </a>

Result:

<center><a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate" target="_blank"><img src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button@2x.png?color=blue" width=300 /></a></center>

On Medium, just download the image then upload it to your post (make sure the image file ends with "@2x" to make it retina size). To link it, select the image then press CMD+K (or CTRL+K on Windows). A pop up menu will show up where you can enter the URL to link the image to (see [Medium support page](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004808847-Image-links)). Here is an example: https://medium.com/open-collective/open-collective-donate-button-e7e6d5965b2c

### Show backers and sponsors

Just add this script:

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:collectiveSlug/banner.js"></script>

where `:collectiveSlug` is the slug of your collective, e.g., `apex` for https://opencollective.com/apex.

You can also add a style object (react style), e.g.,

    <script src='https://opencollective.com/:collectiveSlug/banner.js?style={"a":{"color":"red"},"h2":{"fontFamily":"Verdana","fontWeight":"normal","fontSize":"20px"}}'></script>

Note: make sure that your style object is parsable with `JSON.stringify`.

#### Examples:

- http://apex.run/#links
- https://www.spinacms.com/

#### How to customize it?

This will use the default styling of your `h1` and `h2` on your page.
You can target them with CSS to customize them:

    #opencollective-banner h1 {
      color: black;
    }

## For backers, sponsors and core contributors

To show the list of collectives that you are backing or managing on your website, just add this script:

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:username/collectives.js"></script>

E.g. https://opencollective.com/opencollective/collectives.js

<script src="https://opencollective.com/opencollective/collectives.js"></script>
