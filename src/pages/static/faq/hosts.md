# FAQ for hosts

### What is a host?
The host is the organization or individual that acts as the fiscal sponsor of one or many Collectives. It receives the funds in the name of the Collective and reimburses the expenses that have been approved by its members.

The host is responsible to do the accounting and to comply with all the tax regulations that apply in its jurisdiction. The Open Collective platforms makes this process easier by providing monthly and yearly reports with all the income and expenses (with their attachment) of the collectives hosted by the host.

The host can define a commission for offering that service to the collective. Hosts on Open Collective charge anything from 0 to 30% depending on what services (branding, fiscal sponsorship, workshops, support, etc) they provide to the Collectives that they host.

A host is basically the financial and legal entity behind the scene that makes it possible for Collectives to receive and pay out money without having to every worry about all the overhead of creating and maintaining a legal entity. By sharing a host, Collectives are effectively mutualizing the cost and overhead of having a legal entity. 

There are diverse examples of Open Collective hosts:

* [The Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) - host to open source software projects
* [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) - host for WWCode Meetup groups
* [Brussels Together](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether) - host for citizen projects in Brussels, Belgium

### Where goes the money raised by the collectives that I host?

Straight to the bank account attached to your Stripe Account.

### How to get the money out?

To get the money out, people submit expenses or invoices on their open collective page (see the "submit expense" button). While you can approve those expenses as the host, it is recommended that you let one of the admins of the collective do it.

Once approved, you can pay out those expenses either manually and record them as paid, or with one click using the PayPal integration (if the submitter of the expense has provided a PayPal email). You can manage all this at the host level on https://opencollective.com/:host/dashboard (replace `:host` with the URL of your host).

### What payment methods do you support to pay out expenses?

Right now, we only support PayPal and "manual" as payout methods. Manual means that you can manually record any money that you received outside of the Open Collective platform (e.g. bank transfer, crypto currency, cash, etc.).

### How to pay out expenses with PayPal?

From your host dashboard (`https://opencollective.com/:host/dashboard`), you can connect your PayPal account  and authorize it to spend for up to $2,000 USD (or equivalent).
Note: make sure that you are connecting a PayPal account that is connected to the same bank account than your Stripe Account.

Then with just one click you can pay out an expense that has been approved. When you run out of your PayPal pre-authorized allowance, you can simply reconnect your PayPal account and you are good to spend another $2,000 USD equivalent.

### What if a collective wants to receive money via bank transfer instead of credit card? (or any other unsupported payment method)

You can allow your collectives to receive donations via bank transfer (or any other payment method that you want). Just share with the instructions they need to share with their donors. Then you can manually record those donations from your host dashboard. Just select the collective in the dropdown menu and click on "Add Funds". You will need to specify the source of the money (e.g. the name of the individual or organization that made the bank transfer) and the host fee that you want to keep for processing such payment (the default is your usual host fee). The balance of the collective will be credited accordingly.
Note that there is no Open Collective platform fee in this case.
