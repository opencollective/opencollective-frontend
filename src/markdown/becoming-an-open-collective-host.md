## What is a host?
The host is the organization or individual that acts as the fiscal sponsor of one or many Collectives. It receives the funds in the name of the Collective and reimburses the expenses that have been approved by its members.

The host is responsible to do the accounting and to comply with all the tax regulations that apply in its jurisdiction. The Open Collective platforms makes this process easier by providing monthly and yearly reports with all the income and expenses (with their attachment) of the collectives hosted by the host.

The host can define a commission for offering that service to the collective. Hosts on Open Collective charge anything from 0 to 30% depending on what services (branding, fiscal sponsorship, workshops, support, etc) they provide to the Collectives that they host.

A host is basically the financial and legal entity behind the scene that makes it possible for Collectives to receive and pay out money without having to every worry about all the overhead of creating and maintaining a legal entity. By sharing a host, Collectives are effectively mutualizing the cost and overhead of having a legal entity. 

There are diverse examples of Open Collective hosts:

* [The Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) - host to open source software projects
* [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) - host for WWCode Meetup groups
* [Brussels Together](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether) - host for citizen projects in Brussels, Belgium

## Why become a host?
By becoming a host, you are enabling groups and communities to collect and disburse money in full transparency, without having to create their own legal entity and bank account. They have their own independent budget that allows them to pursue their activities. It's a great way to build a decentralized organization or movement with independent teams/projects, while keeping overhead costs down for each project.

## Who are hosts?

* [Open Collective Chapters](https://opencollective.com/chapters) are general purpose hosts that you can create in your own region. This is our way of developing Open Collective as a decentralized organization.
* HQ/umbrella organizations with Collectives for each of their chapters (e.g. [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode))
* Organizations that support an ecosystem by hosting Collectives in a specific area/vertical/topic (e.g. [The Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource))
* Charitable organizations who host Collectives with charitable purposes that align with their mission
* Organizations that host different Collectives in a certain city or country (e.g. [BrusselsTogether](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether))
* Bitcoin/Ether wallets who convert donations into fiat money and store it in a Collective’s wallet

## Things to consider when becoming a host 

* Have you looked into the tax implications in your country of being a fiscal sponsor?
* Have you thought about a system for onboarding new Collectives?
* Do you have a Stripe and PayPal account set up (and a bank account to connect them to)?
* Only the host has access to the underlying bank account and can therefore pay the expenses that have been approved by the administrators of the hosted collectives.

## What are the legal liabilities?
As a host, you are responsible for the financial activity flowing through your bank account. For example, you need to make sure that your Collectives are not doing money laundering or other nefarious activities. So you don't want to open the door to just anyone to create a Collective on your host. You'll want to think about some policies for determining whether a Collective is a good fit. 

We give you tools to manage the activity going on on your host - you have to approve the creation of all new Collectives, and you will review/approve all their expenses. The Open Collective interface makes this fast and easy.

## Requirements

To be host, you need to have a legal entity and a bank account. You could also do it as an individual with your personal bank account, but remember you will be personally responsible for any tax/legal implications. You will also need to create a PayPal and a Stripe account connected to your Host bank account.

## Set Up Your Host

* If you don't have an Open Collective Account yet, go to https://opencollective.com/signin to create one

* Create an organization (https://opencollective.com/organizations/new) to represent the legal entity that will be the host

* Connect a Stripe Account to your organization on https://opencollective.com/:collective/edit?service=stripe#connectedAccounts (replace `:collective` by the slug of your organization page)

* Send us an email with the URL of your organization page. Once approved, anyone will be able to apply to create a collective on https://opencollective.com/:collective/apply - you will receive an email with a button to accept their application. Once accepted, their collective will be able to collect money using your Stripe Account.

* Any administrator (core contributor) of the Host Organization will be able to pay (or mark as paid) any expense submitted to any collective hosted by that host.
