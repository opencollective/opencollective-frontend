Although they operate in different areas (civic innovation, urbanism, social inclusiveness), they all share the same purpose: rebuild the city from the bottom-up. \n\nThe next meetup will take place at the all-new BeCentral, a grass-roots initiative aiming to boost Belgium as a digital front-runner. \n\nJoin us to discover 3 ambitious projects happening in Brussels.\n\nSchedule: \n\n7 pm - Doors open \n\n7:30 pm - Introduction to #brusselstogether\n\n7:40 pm - [Share Food](https://www.facebook.com/sharefoodbrussels/) - Sharing instead of wasting\n\n7:55 pm - [Communa ASBL](https://www.facebook.com/asblCommuna/) - Turning empty buildings into socio-cultural centers \n\n8:10 pm - [Veganizer](https://opencollective.com/veganizerbxl) - Let's make Brussels more Vegan Friendly! \n\n8:30 pm - How do *YOU* make Brussels better.
