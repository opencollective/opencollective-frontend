## Typography

The main way to deal with typography is through the components in `components/Text.js`.

### Typeface & fonts

The main font on Doohi Collective is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). The colors can vary from `black.50` to `black.900` (the darkest).

<div>

You can configure the scale through `fontSize` and `lineHeight` props.
