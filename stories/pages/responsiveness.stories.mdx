## Responsiveness

### Responsive props

The main way to deal with responsiveness in our codebase is through
the [responsive props or styled-system](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles).

We use the following breakpoints:

<table style={{ maxWidth: 350, width: '100%' }}>
  <thead>
    <th align="left">Name</th>
    <th align="left">Value (em)</th>
    <th align="left">Value (px)</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {breakpoints.map(breakpoint => (
      <tr key={breakpoint}>
        <td>{getViewportFromWidth(emToPx(breakpoint))}</td>
        <td>{breakpoint}</td>
        <td>{emToPx(breakpoint)}px</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

Based on that, the following props will be applied:

<pre>
  {`
  <Box
    height={[
      10, // Default value
      20, // Applied above ${BREAKPOINTS_NAMES[0]} (${BREAKPOINTS_WIDTHS[0]}px)
      30, // Applied above ${BREAKPOINTS_NAMES[1]} (${BREAKPOINTS_WIDTHS[1]}px)
      40, // Applied above ${BREAKPOINTS_NAMES[2]} (${BREAKPOINTS_WIDTHS[2]}px)
      50, // Applied above ${BREAKPOINTS_NAMES[3]} (${BREAKPOINTS_WIDTHS[3]}px)
    ]}
  />
`}
</pre>

Which will translate to the following CSS:

```css
.Box-hash {
  height: 10px;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  .Box-hash {
    height: 20px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  .Box-hash {
    height: 30px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 64em) {
  .Box-hash {
    height: 40px;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 88em) {
  .Box-hash {
    height: 50px;
  }
}
```

### withViewport

`withViewport` is a helper to handle responsiveness from JS. Its usage is strongly discouraged if an alternative exists with CSS because:

- It's normally CSS responsibility to handle the responsiveness
- CSS is more performant to handle that
- We don't have any info on the screen resolution during SSR

That being said there are legit use cases for it, for example when the layout for a component
is completely different between mobile and desktop and cannot be reconciled with flex and
responsive props.
